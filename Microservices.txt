Microservicio:
set of practices 
increase speed
scale
principal and architectural patterns

*Micro
Does one thing 
Scope of functionalities
identify sub-domains

Service: 
Independently deployable component
Message based communication
Are small, autonomous services that collaborate to form an application.

**Monolitic:
Single database
User interface
expose apis 
multiple instances (scale)

pros: Simple to develop, build, test, deploy
cons: code harder to undestand, growing teams, new team members productivity, huge database

*Microservice:
Identify subdomains and have dependencies. Each subdomain have their database.

****Organization: team por subdomain, right-sized teams, independent, agile and devops
Code base: have documentation, and repository (git).

****Data Store: Independent, different requirements (realtion, no relational)

****User interface: Independent teams, own set of components, unique UI, single application. 
UI composition (server, client side)

****Services: remote procedure invocation (request/reply) sync or async, rest, soap
Mesagging: broker or channel (publish, subscribe) kafka
Protocol Format Exchange (text, xml, json, yaml) easy complement 
Apis and contracts: swagger for check the documentation (what do you need for invocate the service)

****Distributed services: 
Service registry: location change is like a phone book. self registration (eureka, zookeeper)
Cross-origin resource sharing: same server(same origin-policy) same protocol, server and port.
Browser restrict cross-origin(When the services isn't in the same server) Access control allow origin throught 
http headers for comunicate to other service from other server.

==========================================================================================================================
Circuit Breaker: network failed, heavy load, domino effect, invoke via proxy and deviate calls (Hystric, JRugged)

-The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from repeatedly attempting an operation that is likely to 
fail, allowing the application to continue executing without wasting resources until the problem is resolved.
Status:
-Closed (Initial state): The circuit is closed and the flow flows uninterrupted.
-Open: The circuit is open and the flow interrupted. Returns the last known exception to the application.
-Half-open: Circuit is half open giving flow a chance to restore

The proxy keeps a counter with the number of errors that occur when making the call, if the number of errors 
exceeds the limit, the proxy sets the state to Open. At the same time a timer is started.

While the state is Open, the calls to the service will not be made, automatically returning the last known error.
How long the proxy remains in this state is marked by the timer setting.

When the timer completes its cycle, the state becomes Half-Open. In this state, the call to the service 
is available again at least once so that:

If the request succeeds it is assumed that the error has been corrected, the error counter is reset to zero and
the proxy state is set to Closed again. Everything works correctly again.
And if an error occurs in the request, it is assumed that the error continues, the state is set back to Open
and the timer is restarted. The service/resource continues to be inaccessible.

==========================================================================================================================

Gateway: single entry points for each client, unified interface, cross-cutting concerns

Provides a single gateway to our entire ecosystem of microservices for requests from mobile devices, 
websites, or other external systems (Dynamic routing monitoring, security).

==========================================================================================================================
****Security: 
Authorization and Autentication:IAM (indentify and access management) rules for users.
single sign-on (OAuth 2.0, SAML)

Access Token: stores information about user, exchange between services (Json Web Token) or cookies.

****Scalabilty and Availability
Scalability vertical: more cpu or RAM
horizontal: more machines, service replication

Client Load Balancing: 
several instances, which instance to choose, registry, round robin, weithgt, capacity.  (Ribbon, Meraki)

Availabilty: Be operational

****Monitoring: Many machines for to see clearly the status of monitoring. (Centralized, Visual) Kibana, Grafana
health check: service running, health check api, database or host status for each service. 
	Log: Undertand behavior, write logs, read each log file, agregate logs for each service instace.
Exception traking: throw a exception, record exceptions, investigate and resolved.
Metrics: perfomance issues, gather statidistics and aggreate metrics.

Auditing: behavior of users, login, logout, visited pages, browsed products.


****Deployment
Host: prhysical or virtual server, on premise, in the cloud
Micro service per host, several services  per host.
Containers: packaging micro service with dependencies, container image and easy to move from enviroment (QA, dev)
Orchestrator: multiple container, multiple machines. (Kubernates, docker) 
Continuos Delivery: Automate deployment, cost-effective, quick and reliable


Domaing logic

Transactional Script:
The Transaction Script pattern organizes all the logic as a single procedure (set of instructions) and communicates with the database generating a single transactional communication session.


Domain Model:
The domain model pattern provides an object-oriented way of dealing with complicated logic. Instead of having one procedure that handles all the business logic for a user action, there are multiple objects, each of which handles a part of the domain logic that is relevant to it.


Table Model:
Table Module organizes domain logic with one class per table in the database, and a single instance of a class contains the various procedures that will act on the data


Data Mapping layer:
Use ORM's : good for relational databases.
Document databases: Easier to map to business objects.
Command query responsability Segregation (CQRS): Separate model for read (queries) and update (commands)

Testing MicroServices:
The test pyramid.

End to end test: complete flow (front - service)
Service level test: Calling service from outside (postman) http request and it talk to a real database.
Unit test: is for test Single method of code and can't access the database. You have to use mock objects and return hard-code values.


Autehticate and Authorization 

Basic Authentication:
Username and password are passed in a HTTP header.
OAuth 2.0 -> Delegate authorization
OpenID Connect -> Json web token
Oauth "flows" -> Interaction between client app, authorization server and microservice.

JWT: information about something that allow for authenticate in the service.

Authorization based on ROle:
-Get is public 
-put or create is necessary to log in.

Authorization based on Data:
-Check the token if not is valid is no authorization. If the token is valid check that the user 
have the correct role for do the operation (put, add, or modify).
