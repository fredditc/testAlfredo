*About yourself:
I am a java tech lead with four years of experience. I've worked with clients in the finance and automatic industries using agile methodologies and 
back-end frameworks such as spring, spring boot, maven, JPA, and docker.

*About last project:
The purpose of the last project that I worked on in the automotive industry was to provide real-time data with the help of interconnectivity through the Internet of Things. There was an app in react native that showed the status of the line in real-time and there was a web page where stadistics of its indicators were generated based on a required date range. I had a team with three resources.
During this project I had to create or modify rest services made with Spring boot, JPA, Hibernate and deployed with Docker. Azure functions were used to ingest data into the database in sql server.
For the team management, I had to plan the sprint, review the status of the developments, validate the sprint closure and meet the teamâ€™s needs.


*What were activities and responsibilities in the last project?
  -Assigned me, attended and validated production errors.
  -Approved the pull requests on the different branches.
  -Generated the docker api deployments on the pre-production servers.
  -I prioritized with the manager the tasks that were going to be taken in the sprint.
  -Organized the sprint planning to review the history points of the tasks.
  -Attended meetings with the other teams (QA or Architecture).
  
 
*What are the good practices that you use for your teams?
-Be always communicated the team for any detail.
-Be transparent with the tasks for the rest of the team.
-Support the team during possible situations that may exist within a project.
-Centralize and structure the shared documents regarding business flows.
